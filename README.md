So sadly I had to create a custom API because of CORS. I didn't really see the point of making a rest for a rest, so I just simply made a small graphql server to interface and make everything easier.

https://www.test-cors.org/#?client_method=GET&client_credentials=false&server_url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.eslgaming.com%2Fplay%2Fv1%2Fleagues%2F177161&server_enable=true&server_status=200&server_credentials=false&server_tabs=remote
